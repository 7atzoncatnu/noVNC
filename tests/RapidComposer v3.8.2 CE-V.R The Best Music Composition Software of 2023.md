With RapidComposer, you can use advanced tools for phrase editing, phrase generation, phrase morphing, phrase grouping, motif development, chord progression editing and more[^1^] [^2^]. You can also use the master track with chords which all phrases automatically conform to, the piano roll with scale notes and chord notes, and the sophisticated MIDI CC editing and recording[^2^].
 
RapidComposer also integrates music theory into its features. You can create great sounding chord progressions, use piano-style phrases even if you have never touched a piano, auto-harmonize melodies, get chord suggestions, load MIDI files with chord detection, use the chord palette or the circle of fifths chart and more[^1^]. RapidComposer will always assist you in songwriting.
 
Another feature of RapidComposer is its smart phrases. Phrases always conform to the current chord and scale on the master track. You can forget about tinkering with notes and just lay out the chords on the master track or drop a chord progression on it. With a key-press you can generate a harmony track with perfect voice leading[^1^]. You can also use various phrase generators and variations to create monophonic or polyphonic patterns, generate melody, change phrases non-destructively and more[^1^] [^2^].
